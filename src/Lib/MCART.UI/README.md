# MCART.UI

## Overview
MCART.UI is a library within the MCART ecosystem that defines some common primitives used in other MCART projects to target UI frameworks.

Generally, this is always included as a transitive dependency in other MCART projects tht target a specific UI framework or OS platform. It is not intended to be used directly by end users, but rather to provide a common set of types and interfaces for other MCART projects to use.
