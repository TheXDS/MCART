# Contributions to MCART
I appreciate you taking the time to consider making a contribution to MCART. MCART is designed as a "repository" of functions that may be useful to others. Any contribution that facilitates the use of C#/VB is welcome!

### Running Tests in MCART
The solution includes test projects compatible with NUnit. This allows tests to be run in any compatible IDE. It is important to note that currently, it is only possible to test the functions of MCART, and not directly on UI elements.

### Reporting Errors
When submitting a new error report, the report must include:
* Version and Branch of MCART used.
* Platform used.
* Function that caused the error. A full path to the function is needed, for example, `TheXDS.MCART.Helpers.ReflectionHelpers.GetField<T>(Expression<Func<T, object?>>)`
* If the element accepts parameters, the parameters used must be included.
* Steps to reproduce the error. (as specific as possible)
* Expected result.
* Undocumented exception or result obtained.

In the case of a display error, the following should be considered:
* That MCART is running in a stable environment, without failures in itself.
* That the error is caused by a defect in MCART, and not by incorrect use of its controls/windows/dialogs.
* That the error is reproducible.
* (Recommended) that the report includes a screenshot of the error, not exceeding the size and resolution limits of 320x200, preferably in PNG format, or JPEG if it is photographic information. If the error requires more than one image and/or a resolution greater than 320x200, an external hosting service for the images should be used.

Alternatively, a new unit test can be created that executes the operation and produces the error.

**Errors generated by Testing with NUnit are not necessarily errors, but should be considered as implementation designs.**

### New Features / Functions
To provide suggestions for new features, it is only necessary to:
* Describe what the new feature should do.
* Establish a target platform. A global feature may also be suggested.
* Ensure that the feature does not exist in .Net/Mono, or that it is an alternative with greater or better functionality than the existing one.
* Ensure that the feature does not conflict with others already implemented in MCART.
* Preferably, use *Test Driven Development* to describe the new function.

To contribute new functions to MCART, it is necessary to establish:
* **Target Platform:** This will determine the project in which contributions should be made.
* **Dependency on Other Components:** While MCART depends on external components for some projects, such as Gtk# on Windows, the dependency on external components should be minimized, although it will be possible to initiate a discussion on this based on the reasons why MCART should depend on a particular third-party component. In some instances, it is possible to create a new project with external dependencies if the feature is useful enough.

### Support for New Platforms
If you are an experienced programmer on any .Net/Mono platform (for example, Cocoa on macOS), your contribution of a new MCART project to support it is completely welcome! The idea of MCART is to support all possible platforms where CIL is available. It is recommended to create a new platform if:
* It is a special contribution for a platform.
* It is a reimplementation of a form, dialog, window, page, control, or widget of MCART on a new platform.

Personally, I must admit that MCART for WPF is probably the version with the most advancements, as it is my area of greatest expertise. However, I intend for the other projects not to fall behind.

For now, the Gtk and Win32 projects (present but non-functional in previous versions of MCART) have been completely deprecated. All their code has lagged to the point of being unmanageable. Eventually, when there is a 1.0 release of MCART, I will explore the possibility of reimplementing versions for these platforms. Read on to learn the reasons.

### Additional Notes
#### Pre-Release Compatibility Break
Currently, MCART is in an early stage of development (despite the apparent current version number, *0.17 Series*). As a library in Pre-Alpha phase, namespaces, classes, methods, resources, and any existing components of MCART are subject to significant changes or deprecation.

A 1.0 version of MCART will indicate that the project content has been curated, no major implementation changes are expected, and any new feature will simply accompany the existing one at the time of a Release, adhering to best practices and the principles of SOLID.

In cases where major implementation changes are necessary, the change will be reflected by an increase in the major version number, becoming a new independent branch of MCART.

#### C# 12.0
Regarding the decision to use such a new version of the language, C# 12.0 offers certain language features on which MCART depends.

It is possible to use the *dotnet* application included in the .Net SDK to compile C# 12.0 code on any supported platform.

It is necessary to install version 8.0 of the SDK, or a later version if a *targeting pack* for .NET 8.0 is also included.

#### Example Projects
Some simple test applications are included in the solution; their purpose is to test certain features that require a UI and that could not be tested directly with xUnit. When contributing to MCART, this distinction should be taken into account before creating tests or an example project.

These projects can also be used with a reference implementation; however, none of the practices that may seem unusual should be considered safe or effective. I reiterate, these are example or test projects, and they are intended solely to demonstrate the API and perform UI tests.

## To conclude...
This document, along with the rest of the MCART documentation, is subject to significant changes. You may still have questions regarding the project. I recommend checking frequently if this documentation has changed, or contacting me directly.
